AsterMiner is a DeFi mining protocol on Binance Smart Chain that allows users to stake ASTER tokens and earn rewards through a unique bonding curve mechanism. Early participants receive better rates, creating a sustainable ecosystem for all users.

- 0% withdrawal tax after 10 compounds
- 10% early withdrawal tax encourages long-term participation

**How It Works:**
1. Deposit ASTER tokens to start mining
2. Virtual golds accumulate based on bonding curve rates
